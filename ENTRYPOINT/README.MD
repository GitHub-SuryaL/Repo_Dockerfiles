### ENTRYPOINT

ENTRYPOINT is also used to run the container just like CMD. But there are few differences.
1. We can't override ENTRYPOINT, but we can override CMD.  
2. We can't override ENTRYPOINT, if you try to do, it will go and append to the ENTRYPOINT command.
3. If you use both CMD & ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile and donâ€™t give any command from terminal (at runtime), CMD   acts as an argument provider to ENTRYPOINT
